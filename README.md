# Gait Event Detection - Experimental Protocol Code

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for controlling a programmable treadmill (Bertec, Fully Instrumented Treadmill) used in gait event detection experiments. The code enables precise control of treadmill speed, inclination, and trial timing to support consistent experimental conditions.

The protocol includes multiple locomotion activities (level ground/ramp walking/running) performed by healthy participants, designed to evaluate the performance of gait event detection algorithms.
